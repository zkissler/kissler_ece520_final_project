# kissler_ece520_final_project

Port a non-trivial amount of Elma to Rust (e.g. Manager, Process, Event and some examples)

Send the name of the repo to the TAs, whoe will keep a list of all repos.

Describe your project goals in detail here. What will you do? What will it mean for you to succeed? What resources will you use (e.g. Elma, other C++ libraries, robots, etc.)

Create a set of at least five milestones that you will achieve, including completing the final project, and state when you will achieve them. A milestone could be as simple as getting particular test or code library to work, or completing the API documentation for your project.

Project Goals:
The goal for this project is to complete option 4 of porting a non-trivial amount of Elma to Rust. I chose this project because I am interested in learning another language as well as understanding how languages have changed/improved since Rust is relatively new compared to C/C++, etc. Success will include not only a summary of preceived improvements and impedements that Rust provides as well as a functional version of Elma. I will note major difficulties as I work through the project. Resources I will require are the Elma code (for porting) as well as a Rust development environment.

Project Milestones:

3/6 - Become familiar with Rust and set up the build environment with Rust

3/9 - Create the code framework (ie: create class outlines) and make sure it compiles

3/13 - Port over code for the Manager, Process, Event and examples used in class

3/16 - Write/port tests for the examples and execute them (may need to research Rust test environments)

3/19 - Port over and test additional classes (Channel, State, etc) as time permits

3/21 - Submit completed project
